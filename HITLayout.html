        <h2>Text Relatedness</h2>
        <p>The goal of the task is to check whether the sentence in <strong>Text 1</strong> correctly describes
        the sentence(s) <br>in <strong>Text 2</strong>.</p>
        <p>The sentence in Text 1 contains a human emotion. Your task is to check whether this human emotion
        is experienced or expressed in the sentence(s) of Text2. Select "Yes" if that is the case, otherwise
        select "No".</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <p><strong>Text 1: </strong>The person is experiencing or expressing happiness</p>
        <p><strong>Text 2: </strong>I was feeling really happy today</p>
        <p>In this case you should select "Yes", because the person is expressing the human
        emotion of happiness.</p>
        <p><strong>Text 1: </strong>The person is experiencing or expressing anger</p>
        <p><strong>Text 2: </strong>It was good to see you today!</p>
        <p>In this example you should select "No", because the person is most probably
        not experiencing anger.</p>
        <h2>Voluntary question</h2>
        <p>All Text 2 sentences have been taken from one particular social platform. You can try and guess the
        name of the social platform at the end of the webpage.</p>
        <p>The guess is entirely voluntary and does not have to be submitted. It does not lead to any bonuses.</p>
        <p>If you want to check whether your guess is correct, you can collect the number keys from all 20 tasks
        in the HITs batch. Knowing those keys, you can unlock an <strong>Extra Task</strong> which contains the answer. 
        The <strong>Extra Task</strong> has already been posted by the same Requester account as the current task.</p>
